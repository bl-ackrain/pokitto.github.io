* <strong>Attention: put only 1 of the .bin files on the Pokitto</strong> (the flash drive called CRP_DISABLD). This will install the SD loader into the memory. Put all of the unzipped .bin files on the SD card. Then you can swap games using the loader. In other words: do not try to put all of the binary files on the Pokitto at once, they will not fit!
